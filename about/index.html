	<p> I am an economist at <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities,</a> with a PhD from the University of Colorado, Boulder. <br><br>
	I am interested in research topics at the intersection of Industrial Organization and Environmental and Agricultural Economics, with an emphasis on food policy.
	My current research focuses on the effects of policies and advocacy strategies on agricultural production systems and consumer behavior. I have expertise in structural estimation and applied theoretical modeling. My research agenda includes understanding the distributional and market structure effects of food taxes and investigating economic policies for innovative foods.

	<br><br>I am originally from Austin, Texas.</p>
