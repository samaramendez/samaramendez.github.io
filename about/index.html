	<p> I am the economist for <a href="http://www.humaneleaguelabs.org/">Humane League Labs,</a> and I recently defended my dissertation as a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am interested in research topics at the intersection of Industrial Organization and Environmental/Agricultural Economics, with an emphasis on food policy.
	My current research focuses on the effects of taxation and labeling policies in imperfectly competitive industries. I have expertise in structural estimation and applied theoretical modeling. My research agenda includes understanding the distributional and market structure effects of food taxes and investigating economic policies for innovative foods.

	<br><br>I am originally from Austin, Texas.</p>
